# Revision Specification for Python Pro

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Python Pro's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of writing clean, performant, and idiomatic Python code.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Python Development to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: An expert Python developer specializing in writing clean, performant, and idiomatic code. Leverages advanced Python features... Focuses on optimizing performance, implementing established design patterns, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage."
- "Key Capabilities: Idiomatic Development: Clean, readable, PEP 8 compliant code with advanced Python features"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that Python development is performed to enable systems/users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., efficient data processing, automated tasks) and that their development involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from raw inputs to manifested functionality.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., a business problem, raw data) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a robust, automated solution). By explicitly linking Python development to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for the system and users rather than just the technical implementation.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Architecture and Code Generation

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Architecture Design: SOLID principles, design patterns, modular and testable code structure"
- "Standard Operating Procedure: Code Generation: Follow a logical, step-by-step approach when generating complex code."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing architecture and generating code, instruct the Python Pro to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress toward desired application outcomes, rather than just "clean" or "performant."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Python Pro will design Python applications that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Python Code or Requirements

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Development Philosophy: Understand First: Analyze existing patterns before coding."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing Python code or requirements for new development or refactoring, instruct the Python Pro to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing code that contribute to current functionality.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Python Pro to understand *why* certain Python patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative improvements rather than just reactive overhauls.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Requirement Analysis

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Standard Operating Procedure: Requirement Analysis: Before writing any code, thoroughly analyze the user's request to ensure a complete understanding of the requirements and constraints."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "understanding the requirements and constraints" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Requirement Analysis: Thoroughly analyze the user's request to define the desired outcomes and identify the structural tension to be resolved."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Python Pro's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Documentation and Explanation" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Standard Operating Procedure: Documentation and Explanation: Offer clear explanations of the implemented logic, design choices, and any complex language features used."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that documentation and explanations should explain how features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Python Pro ensures that the "why" and "how" of Python development are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Python Pro's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on Python applications is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
