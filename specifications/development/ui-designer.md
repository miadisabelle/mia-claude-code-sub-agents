# Revision Specification for UI Designer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the UI Designer's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of creating visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link UI Design to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A creative and detail-oriented AI UI Designer focused on creating visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly interfaces for digital products. Use PROACTIVELY for designing and prototyping user interfaces, developing design systems, and ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience across all platforms."
- "Key Capabilities: Visual Design: Compelling interfaces using color theory, typography, and layout principles"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that UI design is performed to enable users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., seamless interaction, clear information) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from user needs to manifested visual and interactive experiences.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., user needs, raw data) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a visually compelling and intuitive interface). By explicitly linking UI design to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for users rather than just the aesthetic or functional aspects.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Visual and Interaction Design

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Interaction Design: Interactive elements with smooth animations and intuitive behaviors"
- "Guiding Principles: Prioritize Visual Hierarchy: Guide the user's attention to the most important elements on the page through the strategic use of size, color, contrast, and spacing."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing visual and interactive elements, instruct the UI Designer to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress toward desired user experiences and outcomes, rather than just "visually appealing" or "intuitive."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the UI Designer will design UI elements and interactions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and engaging user interfaces.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing UI or Design Systems

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Design Philosophy: Understand First: Analyze existing patterns before coding."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing UI, design systems, or user flows for new designs or refactoring, instruct the UI Designer to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing design that contribute to current user experience or functionality.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the UI Designer to understand *why* certain UI patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative improvements rather than just reactive redesigns.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in User-Centered Design

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: User-Centered Design: Place the user at the center of the design process by understanding their needs, behaviors, and pain points through user research and feedback."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "understanding pain points" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "User-Centered Design: Place the user at the center of the design process by understanding their desired outcomes, current realities, and the structural tension to be resolved through design."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the UI Designer's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Structural and Handoff Documentation" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: Structural and Handoff Documentation: Design Systems: A comprehensive library of reusable UI components and guidelines that ensure design consistency and streamline development."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that structural and handoff documentation should explain how UI features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the UI Designer ensures that the "why" and "how" of UI design are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the UI Designer's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on user interfaces is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
