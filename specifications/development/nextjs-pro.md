# Revision Specification for Next.js Pro

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Next.js Pro's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of building high-performance, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications with Next.js.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Next.js Development to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: An expert Next.js developer specializing in building high-performance, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications."
- "Key Capabilities: Rendering Mastery: Strategic use of SSR, SSG, ISR, and client-side rendering for optimal performance"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that Next.js applications are built to enable users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., fast loading, seamless navigation, high search ranking) and that their development involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from user needs to manifested web experiences.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., user expectations, web performance metrics) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., an exceptional user experience, top SEO ranking). By explicitly linking Next.js development to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for users rather than just the technical implementation.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Rendering Strategy and Routing

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: App Router Expertise: Advanced routing, layouts, loading states, error boundaries, parallel routes"
- "Standard Operating Procedure: Data Fetching and State Management: Choose the optimal data fetching method (SSR, SSG, or client-side) based on the specific requirements of each page."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing rendering strategies and routing, instruct the Next.js Pro to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress toward desired application outcomes, rather than just "optimal performance" or "intuitive route management."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Next.js Pro will design rendering and routing solutions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and engaging web applications.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Web Applications or Requirements

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Development Philosophy: Understand First: Analyze existing patterns before coding."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing web applications, systems, or requirements for new Next.js development or refactoring, instruct the Next.js Pro to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing system that contribute to current functionality or user experience.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Next.js Pro to understand *why* certain web patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative Next.js implementations rather than just reactive overhauls.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Performance and Optimization

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Performance and Optimization: Performance Monitoring: Uses tools like Lighthouse and Next.js' built-in Web Vitals to identify and address performance bottlenecks."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Performance and Optimization: Uses tools like Lighthouse and Next.js' built-in Web Vitals to drive desired outcome creation and resolve structural tension in application performance."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Next.js Pro's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Documentation" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Output Format: Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation for all components and functions, including prop types and usage examples."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that documentation should explain how features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Next.js Pro ensures that the "why" and "how" of Next.js development are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Next.js Pro's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on web applications is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
