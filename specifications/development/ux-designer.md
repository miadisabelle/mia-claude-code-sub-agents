# Revision Specification for UX Designer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the UX Designer's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and narrative-driven nature of user experience design.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link UX Design to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A creative and empathetic professional focused on enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and a product. Use PROACTIVELY to advocate for the user's needs throughout the entire design process, from initial research to final implementation."
- "Key Capabilities: User Research: Comprehensive research through interviews, surveys, usability testing and data analysis"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that UX design is performed to enable users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., completing a task efficiently, feeling delighted) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from the user's current state to their desired outcome.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., user pain points, existing workflows) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a seamless, intuitive user experience). By explicitly linking UX design to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for users.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in User Flow and Interaction Design

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Information Architecture: Effective content structure, sitemaps, user flows, navigation systems"
- "Key Capabilities: Interaction Design: Intuitive user interaction patterns and engaging experience flows"

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing user flows and interactions, instruct the UX Designer to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired user outcomes, rather than just "intuitive" or "engaging."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the UX Designer will design user experiences that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and satisfying user journeys.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing User Behaviors or Products

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: User Research and Analysis: Conduct comprehensive user research... to understand user behaviors, needs, and motivations."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing user behaviors, products, or research data for new designs or improvements, instruct the UX Designer to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing experience that contribute to user satisfaction or successful task completion.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the UX Designer to understand *why* certain user behaviors or product features are effective, leading to more informed and generative design solutions.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Guiding Principles

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Guiding Principles: User-Centricity: The user is at the heart of every decision. Your primary goal is to advocate for their needs and create products that solve their problems."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the guiding principle to emphasize the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "User-Centricity: The user's desired outcomes are at the heart of every decision. Your primary goal is to advocate for their needs and create products that enable them to achieve their desired outcomes by resolving structural tension."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the UX Designer's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Explicitly Mention "Narrative Remixing" for User Journey Maps and User Personas

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: Research & Analysis Artifacts: User Journey Maps: Visualizations of the user's experience... User Personas: Fictional characters created to represent the different user types..."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that "User Journey Maps" are a form of "Narrative Remixing" where the user's experience is framed as a story, and "User Personas" can be developed using "Character Archetype Mapping" from the Narrative Remixing framework.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework provides a structured approach to transforming narratives. By explicitly linking User Journey Maps and User Personas to this framework, the UX Designer can leverage its principles to create more compelling, insightful, and actionable artifacts that effectively communicate user experiences and needs.

### 6. Link "Design & Structure Artifacts" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: Design & Structure Artifacts: Sitemaps & User Flows: Diagrams that illustrate the structure of a website or app and the paths a user can take to complete a task."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that design and structure artifacts should explain how user experiences naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the UX Designer ensures that the "why" and "how" of UX design are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and narrative-driven approach within the UX Designer's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on user experience is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and effective storytelling.
