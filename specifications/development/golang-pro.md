# Revision Specification for Golang Pro

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Golang Pro's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of architecting, writing, and refactoring Go applications.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Go Application Development to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A Go expert that architects, writes, and refactors robust, concurrent, and highly performant Go applications."
- "Key Capabilities: System Architecture: Design scalable microservices and distributed systems with clear API boundaries"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that Go applications are built to enable systems/users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., efficient data processing, high concurrency) and that their development involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from raw inputs to manifested functionality.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., complex data, high load) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., performant, reliable service). By explicitly linking Go development to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for the system and users rather than just the technical implementation.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Architecture and Concurrency Design

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Advanced Concurrency: Goroutines, channels, worker pools, fan-in/fan-out, race condition detection"
- "Core Competencies: System Architecture: Designing microservices and distributed systems with clear API boundaries (gRPC, REST)."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing architecture and concurrency, instruct the Golang Pro to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired application outcomes, rather than just "robust" or "performant."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Golang Pro will design Go applications that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Go Code or Requirements

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Development Philosophy: Understand First: Analyze existing patterns before coding."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing Go code or requirements for new development or refactoring, instruct the Golang Pro to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing code that contribute to current functionality.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Golang Pro to understand *why* certain Go patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative improvements rather than just reactive overhauls.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Core Philosophy

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Philosophy: Benchmark, Then Optimize: Do not prematurely optimize. Write clean code first, then use profiling tools like `pprof` to identify and resolve actual bottlenecks."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the guiding principle to emphasize the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Benchmark, Then Optimize: Focus on creating desired outcomes, using profiling to resolve structural tension and achieve natural progression."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Golang Pro's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Documentation" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Output Specification: Documentation: All public functions, types, and constants must have clear GoDoc comments."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that documentation should explain how features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Golang Pro ensures that the "why" and "how" of Go development are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Golang Pro's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on Go applications is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
