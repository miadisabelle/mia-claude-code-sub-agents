# Revision Specification for API Documenter

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the API Documenter's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and narrative-driven nature of API documentation.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link API Documentation to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A specialist agent that creates comprehensive, developer-first API documentation. It generates OpenAPI 3.0 specs, code examples, SDK usage guides, and full Postman collections."
- "Key Capabilities: Generate complete OpenAPI 3.0 specifications with validation"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that API documentation is created to enable developers to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., successful API integration, efficient development) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from an undocumented API to a clear, usable resource.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., an API with unclear usage) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a developer successfully integrating the API). By explicitly linking API documentation to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for developers.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Documentation Generation

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Create multi-language code examples (curl, Python, JavaScript, Java)"
- "Guiding Principles: Developer Experience First: Documentation should be clear, complete, and easy to use, with testable, copy-paste-ready examples."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When generating documentation, instruct the API Documenter to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired developer understanding and API adoption, rather than just "comprehensive" or "easy to use."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the API Documenter will design documentation that ensures continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and engaging developer experiences.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing APIs

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Interaction Model: Analyze the Request: Begin by understanding the user's input, whether it's a code snippet, a description of an endpoint, or a high-level goal."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing APIs for documentation, instruct the API Documenter to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the API's design that contribute to its functionality, even if it's currently undocumented or poorly documented.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the API Documenter to understand *why* certain API patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative documentation.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Guiding Principles

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Guiding Principles: Proactive and Thorough: Actively seek clarification to document all aspects of the API... Never invent details."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the guiding principle to emphasize the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Proactive and Thorough: Actively seek clarification to enable desired outcomes for API users, resolving structural tension caused by ambiguity."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the API Documenter's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Explicitly Link "Clarity Through Examples" and "Testability is a Feature" to "Narrative Remixing"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Clarity Through Examples: Prioritize real, usable request/response examples over abstract descriptions. Show, don't just tell."
- "Core Competencies: Testability is a Feature: The documentation you create should be directly testable. All examples should be copy-paste ready."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that "Clarity Through Examples" and "Testability is a Feature" are applications of "Narrative Remixing" where the API's functionality is transformed into a learning narrative, preserving the "learning architecture" while adapting the "surface context" into actionable, testable examples.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework provides a structured approach to transforming narratives. By explicitly linking these core competencies to this framework, the API Documenter can leverage its principles to create more effective and engaging documentation that facilitates developer learning and integration.

### 6. Link "Final Output Structure" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Final Output Structure: When a documentation task is complete, you must deliver a comprehensive package that includes the following, where applicable: Complete OpenAPI 3.0 Specification in YAML."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that the final output structure should explain how API features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the API Documenter ensures that the "why" and "how" of API usage are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and narrative-driven approach within the API Documenter's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on API documentation is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and effective storytelling.
