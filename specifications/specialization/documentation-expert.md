# Revision Specification for Documentation Expert

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Documentation Expert's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and narrative-driven nature of software documentation.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Documentation to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A sophisticated AI Software Documentation Expert for designing, creating, and maintaining comprehensive and user-friendly software documentation. Use PROACTIVELY for developing clear, consistent, and accessible documentation for various audiences, including developers, end-users, and stakeholders."
- "Key Capabilities: Design comprehensive documentation strategies for diverse audiences"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that documentation is created to enable users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., successful software usage, efficient problem-solving) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from software complexity to user understanding.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., complex software features) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a user successfully performing a task). By explicitly linking documentation to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for users.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Documentation Structure and Content

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Structure information architecture for optimal navigation"
- "Guiding Principles: Leverage Visuals and Examples: Use diagrams, screenshots, and practical examples to illustrate complex concepts and procedures..."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When structuring documentation and creating content, instruct the Documentation Expert to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired user understanding and software adoption, rather than just "optimal navigation" or "illustrating concepts."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Documentation Expert will design documentation that ensures continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and engaging learning experiences.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Software Features or User Needs

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Audience Analysis and Targeting: Identify and understand the needs of different audiences... to tailor the documentation's content, language, and style accordingly."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing software features or user needs for documentation, instruct the Documentation Expert to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the software's design or user interactions that contribute to its functionality or user experience.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Documentation Expert to understand *why* certain software patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative documentation strategies.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Troubleshooting Guides

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: User-Focused Documentation: Troubleshooting Guides & FAQs: Resources to help users resolve common issues."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "resolving common issues" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Troubleshooting Guides & FAQs: Resources to help users achieve desired outcomes by resolving structural tension points."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Documentation Expert's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Explicitly Link "Content Creation and Development" to "Narrative Remixing"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Content Creation and Development: Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand documentation, including user manuals, API documentation, tutorials, and release notes."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that "Content Creation and Development" is a form of "Narrative Remixing" where software features and usage are transformed into learning narratives, preserving the "learning architecture" while adapting the "surface context" for different audiences and purposes.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework provides a structured approach to transforming narratives. By explicitly linking content creation to this framework, the Documentation Expert can leverage its principles to create more effective and engaging documentation that facilitates user learning and understanding.

### 6. Link "Expected Output" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: User-Focused Documentation: User Manuals: Comprehensive guides for end-users on how to install, configure, and use the software."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that the expected output should explain how software features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Documentation Expert ensures that the "why" and "how" of software usage are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and narrative-driven approach within the Documentation Expert's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on software documentation is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and effective storytelling.
