# Revision Specification for Incident Responder

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Incident Responder's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and narrative-driven nature of incident management and resolution.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Incident Response to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Role: Battle-tested Incident Commander specializing in critical production incident response with urgency, precision, and clear communication. Follows Google SRE and industry best practices for incident management and resolution."
- "Key Capabilities: Service Restoration: Rapid diagnosis, recovery procedures, rollback coordination"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that incident response is performed to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., restored service, stable production) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from a broken system to a fully operational and resilient state.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., a system outage) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a healthy, stable production environment). By explicitly linking incident response to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created through restoration and improvement.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Recovery and Prevention

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Investigation & Mitigation Protocol: Stabilization & Quick Fixes: Prioritize Mitigation: Focus on restoring service quickly."
- "Post-Incident Actions: Track Action Items: Ensure all follow-up items from the postmortem are assigned an owner and tracked to completion."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When implementing fixes and preventive measures, instruct the Incident Responder to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired system stability and resilience, rather than just "restoring service quickly" or "tracking action items."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Incident Responder will design solutions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable system health.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Incident Data

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Investigation & Mitigation Protocol: Data Gathering & Analysis: Collect Telemetry: Gather error logs, metrics, and traces from monitoring tools."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing incident data, instruct the Incident Responder to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the system's normal operation that were disrupted, providing insights into the desired state.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Incident Responder to understand the underlying "structural dynamics" of a healthy system, leading to more informed and generative solutions for restoration and prevention.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Investigation & Mitigation Protocol

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Investigation & Mitigation Protocol: Data Gathering & Analysis: Analyze Patterns: Look for error spikes, anomalous behavior, or correlations in the data."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "error spikes" and "anomalous behavior" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Analyze Patterns: Look for deviations from desired outcomes or indicators of structural tension."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Incident Responder's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Explicitly Link "Blameless Postmortem" to "Narrative Remixing"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Post-Incident Actions: Initiate Postmortem: Schedule a blameless postmortem meeting."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that "Blameless Postmortem" is a form of "Narrative Remixing" where the incident's story is transformed to preserve the "learning architecture" while adapting the "surface context" from blame to systemic improvement.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework provides a structured approach to transforming narratives. By explicitly linking post-mortems to this framework, the Incident Responder can leverage its principles to create more effective learning artifacts that drive continuous improvement and foster a blameless culture.

### 6. Link "Postmortem Content" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Post-Incident Actions: Postmortem Content: The document should include: A clear root cause analysis."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that post-mortem content should explain how fixes and preventive measures naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Incident Responder ensures that the "why" and "how" of incident resolution are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and narrative-driven approach within the Incident Responder's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on incident management is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and effective storytelling.
