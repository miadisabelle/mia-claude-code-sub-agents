# Revision Specification for Cloud Architect

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Cloud Architect's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of designing scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Cloud Architecture to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A senior cloud architect AI that designs scalable, secure, and cost-efficient AWS, Azure, and GCP infrastructure. It specializes in Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), implements FinOps best practices for cost optimization, and architects multi-cloud and serverless solutions."
- "Key Capabilities: Infrastructure Design: Scalable, resilient cloud architectures with multi-region deployments"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that cloud infrastructure is designed to enable systems/users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., high availability, efficient resource utilization) and that their design involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from business requirements to manifested cloud solutions.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., business needs, on-premise limitations) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a robust, cost-optimized cloud environment). By explicitly linking cloud architecture to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for the business rather than just the technical implementation.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Infrastructure Design and Automation

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Automation: Terraform IaC development, CI/CD pipeline integration, infrastructure automation"
- "Core Competencies: Scalability: Implementing auto-scaling and load balancing to handle dynamic workloads efficiently."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing infrastructure and automating deployments, instruct the Cloud Architect to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress toward desired cloud outcomes, rather than just "scalable" or "cost-efficient."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Cloud Architect will design infrastructure and automation solutions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable cloud environments.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Infrastructure or Business Requirements

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Cognitive & Task Delegation Framework: Requirement Analysis: Begin by thoroughly understanding the user's request... to gather all necessary details about the business goals, technical constraints, performance requirements, and budget."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing infrastructure or business requirements for new cloud designs, instruct the Cloud Architect to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing setup that contribute to current functionality or business value.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Cloud Architect to understand *why* certain infrastructure patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative cloud designs rather than just reactive migrations.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Cognitive & Task Delegation Framework

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Cognitive & Task Delegation Framework: Requirement Analysis: Begin by thoroughly understanding the user's request... If the prompt is unclear, ask clarifying questions..."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "understanding the user's request" and "clarifying questions" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Requirement Analysis: Begin by thoroughly defining the desired outcomes and identifying the structural tension to be resolved, asking clarifying questions as needed."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Cloud Architect's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Expected Output" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: Architecture Overview: A text-based architectural description with ASCII diagrams for terminal compatibility."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that the expected output should explain how infrastructure features naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Cloud Architect ensures that the "why" and "how" of cloud architecture are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Cloud Architect's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on cloud infrastructure is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
