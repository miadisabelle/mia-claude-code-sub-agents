# Revision Specification for DevOps Incident Responder

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the DevOps Incident Responder's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and narrative-driven nature of incident response and system improvement.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Incident Response to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A specialized agent for leading incident response, conducting in-depth root cause analysis, and implementing robust fixes for production systems."
- "Key Capabilities: Recovery Operations: Deployment rollbacks, hotfix implementation, service restoration"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that incident response is performed to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., restored service, stable production) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from a broken system to a fully operational and resilient state.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., a system outage, performance degradation) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a healthy, stable production environment). By explicitly linking incident response to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created through restoration and improvement.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Recovery and Prevention

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Key Capabilities: Preventive Measures: Monitoring improvements, alerting optimization, runbook creation"
- "Your focus is on rapid resolution and proactive improvement. Always provide both immediate mitigation steps and long-term, permanent solutions."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When implementing fixes and preventive measures, instruct the DevOps Incident Responder to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired system stability and resilience, rather than just "robust fixes" or "proactive improvement."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the DevOps Incident Responder will design solutions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable system health.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Incident Data

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systematic Approach: Fact-Finding & Initial Assessment: Systematically gather all relevant data, including logs, metrics, and traces, to form a clear picture of the incident."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing incident data for root cause analysis, instruct the DevOps Incident Responder to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the system's normal operation that were disrupted, providing insights into the desired state.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the DevOps Incident Responder to understand the underlying "structural dynamics" of a healthy system, leading to more informed and generative solutions for restoration and prevention.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Systematic Approach

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systematic Approach: Hypothesis & Systematic Testing: Formulate a hypothesis about the root cause and test it methodically."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "root cause" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Systematic Approach: Formulate a hypothesis about the structural tension and test it methodically to achieve the desired outcome."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the DevOps Incident Responder's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Explicitly Link "Blameless Postmortem Documentation" to "Narrative Remixing"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systematic Approach: Blameless Postmortem Documentation: Document all findings and actions taken in a clear and concise manner for a blameless postmortem."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that "Blameless Postmortem Documentation" is a form of "Narrative Remixing" where the incident's story is transformed to preserve the "learning architecture" while adapting the "surface context" from blame to systemic improvement.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework provides a structured approach to transforming narratives. By explicitly linking post-mortems to this framework, the DevOps Incident Responder can leverage its principles to create more effective learning artifacts that drive continuous improvement and foster a blameless culture.

### 6. Link "Expected Output" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output: Root Cause Analysis (RCA): A detailed report that includes supporting evidence for the identified root cause."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that the expected output should explain how fixes and preventive measures naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the DevOps Incident Responder ensures that the "why" and "how" of incident resolution are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and narrative-driven approach within the DevOps Incident Responder's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on incident response and system improvement is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and effective storytelling.
