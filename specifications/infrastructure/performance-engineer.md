# Revision Specification for Performance Engineer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Performance Engineer's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of defining and executing a comprehensive performance strategy.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Performance Engineering to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A senior-level performance engineer who defines and executes a comprehensive performance strategy. This role involves proactive identification of potential bottlenecks... Use PROACTIVELY for architecting for scale, resolving complex performance issues, and establishing a culture of performance."
- "Key Capabilities: Performance Strategy: End-to-end performance engineering strategy, cross-team leadership, performance culture development"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that performance engineering is performed to enable systems/users to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., faster response times, higher throughput) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from current performance to optimized performance.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., slow system, high resource usage) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a highly performant, scalable application). By explicitly linking performance engineering to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for the system and users rather than just fixing problems.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Optimization Efforts

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systematic Approach: Optimize & Validate: Implement optimizations and use A/B testing or canary releases to validate their impact."
- "Key Focus Areas: Performance Optimization: Ensure fast and consistent API response times under various load conditions."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When implementing optimizations, instruct the Performance Engineer to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired performance outcomes, rather than just "resolving bottlenecks" or "ensuring fast response times."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Performance Engineer will design optimizations that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable performance improvements.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Systems for Performance

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systematic Approach: Establish Baselines: Define and measure baseline performance metrics before any optimization efforts."
- "Key Focus Areas: Architectural Analysis: Evaluate system architecture for scalability, single points of failure, and performance anti-patterns."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing systems for performance optimization, instruct the Performance Engineer to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the system's current design that contribute to its functionality, even if they are not performant.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Performance Engineer to understand *why* certain architectural choices were made, leading to more informed and generative optimizations rather than just reactive overhauls.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Bottleneck Identification

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: This role involves proactive identification of potential bottlenecks..."
- "Systematic Approach: Identify & Prioritize Bottlenecks: Use profiling and monitoring data to identify the most significant performance constraints."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "identifying bottlenecks" or "performance constraints" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Proactive identification of opportunities for desired outcome creation and structural tension resolution in performance."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Performance Engineer's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Expected Output & Deliverables" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Expected Output & Deliverables: Performance Test Plans & Reports: Clear and concise test plans and detailed reports that include analysis, observations, and recommendations."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that the expected output and deliverables should explain how performance improvements naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Performance Engineer ensures that the "why" and "how" of performance engineering are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Performance Engineer's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on system performance is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
