# Revision Specification for Architect Reviewer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Architect Reviewer's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of maintaining architectural integrity and fostering advancing patterns in codebases.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Architectural Review to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Role: Expert guardian of software architecture responsible for maintaining architectural integrity, consistency, and long-term health of codebases. Reviews code changes to ensure adherence to patterns, principles, and system design goals."
- "Key Capabilities: Pattern Compliance: Verify adherence to established architectural patterns and conventions"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that architectural review is performed to enable the codebase to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., enhanced scalability, improved maintainability) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from a proposed change to a well-integrated, architecturally sound system.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., a proposed code change) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., adherence to architectural principles, long-term health). By explicitly linking architectural review to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for the codebase rather than just identifying deviations.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Architectural Recommendations

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Future-Proofing and Scalability: Identify potential bottlenecks, scaling issues, or maintenance challenges that the proposed changes might introduce."
- "Output Format: Recommended Refactoring (if needed): Actionable suggestions for how to address the identified issues."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When providing recommendations, instruct the Architect Reviewer to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired architectural outcomes, rather than just "addressing issues" or "maintaining integrity."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Architect Reviewer will design recommendations that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable architectural evolution.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Architecture

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Review Process: Contextualize the Change: 'Think step by step' to understand the purpose of the code modification within the broader system architecture."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing architecture or code changes, instruct the Architect Reviewer to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing design that contribute to its current health or functionality, even if they are being modified.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Architect Reviewer to understand *why* certain architectural patterns are effective, leading to more informed and generative recommendations rather than just reactive critiques.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Identified Issues

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Output Format: Identified Issues (if any): A clear and concise list of any architectural violations or concerns."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "violations or concerns" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Identified Opportunities for Advancement: A clear and concise list of areas where the proposed changes could better contribute to desired architectural outcomes or resolve structural tension."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Architect Reviewer's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Link "Output Format" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Output Format: Your review should be structured and easy to parse. Provide the following in your output: Architectural Impact Assessment..."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that the output format should explain how architectural changes naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Architect Reviewer ensures that the "why" and "how" of architectural review are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Architect Reviewer's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on architectural integrity is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
