# Revision Specification for Product Manager

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Product Manager's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, reinforcing its role as a driver of desired outcome creation and natural progression through structural tension.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Use "Desired Outcome" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Role: Strategic Product Manager specializing in defining product vision, strategy, and roadmaps..."
- "Objective-Driven Logic: Excels at breaking down a high-level goal (the 'Why') into a logical sequence of buildable features and tasks..."
- "Anchor on the Core Objective: Every generated task must directly trace back to the primary goal defined in the initial prompt."

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Core Competencies" sections, explicitly use "desired outcome" as the primary focus.
- Introduce "structural tension" as the dynamic force driving the product roadmap and task prioritization.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes defining "Creating" as focusing on "bringing desired results into being" and "manifestation of envisioned outcomes." The RISE framework centers on "Desired Outcome Definition" and "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" and "Desired Outcome." By explicitly using this language, the Product Manager's core function becomes more aligned with a generative, creative mindset, moving beyond just "goals" to the underlying "tension" that drives progress.

### 2. Reframe "Tasks" as "Creative Advancement Steps"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Objective-Driven Logic: Excels at breaking down a high-level goal (the 'Why') into a logical sequence of buildable features and tasks..."
- "Prioritized Task Queue: A simple, ordered list representing the immediate backlog."

**Proposed Revision:**
- While retaining the concept of "tasks," introduce the framing of these as "Creative Advancement Steps" within a larger "Creative Advancement Scenario." This emphasizes their role in enabling desired outcomes.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework introduces "Creative Advancement Scenarios" which focus on "Natural Progression Steps" towards an "Achieved Outcome." By framing tasks in this manner, the Product Manager reinforces the generative nature of the work, ensuring that each step is seen as contributing to a larger creative manifestation rather than just a discrete item on a list.

### 3. Integrate "Current Reality" More Explicitly in Task Definition

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systemic Context Awareness: Natively consumes and interprets data from the `context-manager` to understand the current state of the codebase, ensuring all new tasks are coherent with the existing system."

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Task Specification" section, add a field for "Current Reality" (or "Starting Structural State") to explicitly define the context from which the task begins.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Tension Analysis" requires a clear understanding of both "Current Structural Reality" and "Desired Structural State." By explicitly including "Current Reality" in each task specification, the Product Manager provides a more complete picture of the "structural tension" that the task aims to resolve, making the task more contextually rich and outcome-oriented.

### 4. Refine "Acceptance Criteria" to be More Outcome-Focused

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Acceptance Criteria: A bulleted list of conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete. These should be verifiable by an automated test."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that Acceptance Criteria should directly verify the "Achieved Outcome" of the "Creative Advancement Scenario," ensuring they are not just about functional completion but about the successful manifestation of the desired result.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
In a "Creative Advancement Scenario," the "Achieved Outcome" is the "Manifested desired result." By linking acceptance criteria directly to this outcome, the Product Manager ensures that the definition of "done" is tied to the successful creation of value, aligning with the generative principles of RISE.

### 5. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Roadmap and Task Queue Descriptions

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Prioritize by Impact on Objective: The task queue is not first-in, first-out. It is a dynamically sorted list based on what will most efficiently advance the core objective."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that the prioritization aims to create "advancing patterns" that support continuous movement toward desired outcomes, rather than just "efficiently advancing."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework differentiates between "Advancing Patterns" and "Oscillating Patterns." By explicitly instructing the Product Manager to prioritize for "advancing patterns," it reinforces the agent's role in designing workflows that lead to inevitable progress and avoid unproductive back-and-forth efforts.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to deepen the Product Manager's alignment with creative orientation principles, transforming its task definition and prioritization into a more explicit process of desired outcome creation and the establishment of natural, advancing patterns.
