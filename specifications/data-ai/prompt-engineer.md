# Revision Specification for Prompt Engineer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Prompt Engineer's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and adaptive nature of prompt engineering.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Prompt Engineering to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Role: Master-level prompt engineer specializing in architecting and optimizing sophisticated LLM interactions. Designs advanced AI systems with focus on pushing model performance to limits..."
- "Systematic Optimization Process: Deconstruct the Goal: Thoroughly analyze the intended application, identifying the core problem and desired outcomes."

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Core Competencies" sections, emphasize that prompt engineering is fundamentally about creating "structural tension" between an LLM's current state and a "desired outcome," and then guiding the LLM through a "natural progression" to resolve that tension and manifest the outcome.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., an LLM's initial state) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a specific, high-quality response). By explicitly linking prompt engineering to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on enabling the LLM to create value.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Prompt Design and Agentic Workflows

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Advanced Prompting: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) & Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT): Decomposing complex problems into a series of logical steps or exploring multiple reasoning paths to enhance accuracy."
- "Agentic Design & Workflows: Planning: Breaking down large goals into smaller, manageable sub-tasks for the AI to execute."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When designing prompts and orchestrating agentic workflows, instruct the Prompt Engineer to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired LLM outcomes, rather than merely "decomposing problems" or "breaking down goals."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Prompt Engineer will design interactions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and predictable LLM behaviors.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Prompts or LLM Outputs

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Systematic Optimization Process: Iterate and Refine: Test Rigorously: Systematically test the prompt with a variety of inputs to identify failure points."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing prompts, LLM outputs, or successful interactions for optimization or refinement, instruct the Prompt Engineer to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" that contribute to the desired outcome.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Prompt Engineer to understand *why* certain prompt structures or interaction patterns are effective in enabling desired outcomes, leading to more informed and generative optimizations.

### 4. Explicitly Link "Contextual Transposition" to Prompt Adaptation

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Model-Specific Expertise: GPT Series: Emphasis on clear, structured instructions and effective use of system prompts."
- "Model-Specific Expertise: Claude Series: Strengths in helpful, honest, and harmless responses, excelling at nuanced and creative tasks."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Add a section or integrate into existing sections how the Prompt Engineer applies "Contextual Transposition" (Linguistic, Structural, Stylistic Layers) when adapting prompts for different LLM models, domains, or specific use cases, preserving the core intent while transforming the surface context.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework's "Contextual Transposition" is highly relevant to prompt engineering, as it involves adapting a "narrative" (the prompt) from one context (e.g., a general-purpose model) to another (e.g., a specialized model or domain). Explicitly detailing this process will enhance the Prompt Engineer's ability to create versatile and effective prompts.

### 5. Reframe "Problem-Solving" in Prompt Design to "Outcome Creation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Reasoning and Problem-Solving: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) & Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT): Decomposing complex problems into a series of logical steps or exploring multiple reasoning paths to enhance accuracy."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "problem-solving" to "outcome creation" or "structural tension resolution" when describing reasoning techniques. For example, "Decomposing complex desired outcomes into a series of logical steps."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Prompt Engineer's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 6. Link "Comprehensive Documentation" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Deliverables: Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed guides on prompt usage, versioning, and performance benchmarks."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that documentation should explain how prompts naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Prompt Engineer ensures that the "why" and "how" of prompt design are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and adaptive capability within the Prompt Engineer's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on LLM interactions is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and contextual transposition.
