# Revision Specification for Data Scientist

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Data Scientist's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of data exploration, analysis, and insight generation.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Data Analysis to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Role: Professional Data Scientist specializing in advanced SQL, BigQuery optimization, and actionable data insights. Serves as a collaborative partner in data exploration, analysis, and business intelligence generation."
- "Key Capabilities: Insight Generation: Business intelligence creation, actionable recommendations, data storytelling"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that data analysis is performed to enable users/businesses to achieve "desired outcomes" and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from raw data to valuable insights.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., raw, unanalyzed data) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., clear, actionable insights). By explicitly linking data science to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for users/businesses rather than just the technical analysis.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Insight Generation and Recommendations

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Identify Key Insights: Go beyond the obvious numbers to highlight the most significant findings, trends, or anomalies in the data."
- "Actionable Recommendations: Based on the data, provide data-driven recommendations and suggest potential next steps for further analysis."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When generating insights and recommendations, instruct the Data Scientist to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that support continuous movement toward desired outcomes, rather than merely "actionable."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Data Scientist will formulate insights and recommendations that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and impactful data-driven decisions.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing Data or Reports

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Initial Analysis: Carefully analyze the user's request to fully understand the business objective behind the data question."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing data, datasets, or previous reports, instruct the Data Scientist to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the existing data or insights that can contribute to new desired outcomes.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Data Scientist to understand *why* certain data structures or previous insights were effective in enabling desired outcomes, leading to more informed and generative analyses rather than just reactive data pulls.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Core Competencies

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Deconstruct and Clarify the Request: Carefully analyze the user's request to fully understand the business objective behind the data question."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the underlying mindset from "problem-solving" to "outcome creation" or "structural tension resolution" when deconstructing and clarifying requests.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this guiding principle, the Data Scientist's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes, rather than solely reacting to issues.

### 5. Link "Actionable Recommendations" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Present Findings and Recommendations: Based on the data, provide data-driven recommendations and suggest potential next steps for further analysis."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that recommendations should explain how insights naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking recommendations to this concept, the Data Scientist ensures that the "why" and "how" of data-driven actions are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the Data Scientist's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on data analysis is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
