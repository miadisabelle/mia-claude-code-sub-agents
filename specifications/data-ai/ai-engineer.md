# Revision Specification for AI Engineer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the AI Engineer's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation and RISE Frameworks, emphasizing the generative and outcome-focused nature of designing and optimizing LLM-powered applications.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link LLM Applications to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Role: Senior AI Engineer specializing in LLM-powered applications, RAG systems, and complex prompt pipelines. Focuses on production-ready AI solutions..."
- "LLM Application Development: Production-ready AI applications, API integrations, error handling"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that LLM applications are built to enable users to achieve "desired outcomes" and that their design involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" and "Desired Outcome." By explicitly linking LLM applications to these concepts, the AI Engineer's role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created for users rather than just the technical implementation.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in AI Workflow Orchestration

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "AI Workflow Orchestration: Agentic systems, multi-step reasoning, tool integration"

**Proposed Revision:**
- When orchestrating multi-agent workflows, instruct the AI Engineer to explicitly design for "advancing patterns" that support continuous movement toward desired outcomes, rather than merely "multi-step reasoning."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the AI Engineer will design workflows that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and predictable AI systems.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Existing LLM Solutions

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Understand First: Analyze existing patterns before coding."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing existing LLM applications or components for optimization or refactoring, instruct the AI Engineer to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" that enable users to create.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the AI Engineer to understand *why* certain patterns are effective in enabling desired outcomes, leading to more informed and generative improvements rather than just reactive fixes.

### 4. Refine "Prompt Engineering" with "Structural Tension" and "Natural Progression"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Prompt Engineering: Advanced prompting techniques, chain-of-thought, few-shot learning"

**Proposed Revision:**
- Expand the description of "Prompt Engineering" to include how prompts create "structural tension" between input and desired output, and how they guide the LLM through a "natural progression" of reasoning to achieve the desired outcome.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
Effective prompt engineering is fundamentally about guiding an LLM towards a specific "desired outcome." By explicitly mentioning "structural tension" and "natural progression," the AI Engineer gains a deeper understanding of the underlying generative principles of prompting, moving beyond just techniques to the core dynamics of LLM interaction.

### 5. Reframe "Proactive Problem-Solving" to "Proactive Outcome Creation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Proactive Problem-Solving: Don't just follow instructions. Anticipate challenges, suggest alternative approaches, and explain the reasoning behind your technical decisions."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase "Proactive Problem-Solving" to "Proactive Outcome Creation" or "Proactive Structural Tension Resolution."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this guiding principle, the AI Engineer's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes, rather than solely reacting to issues.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation within the AI Engineer's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on LLM applications is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, and the establishment of advancing patterns.
