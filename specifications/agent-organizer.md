# Revision Specification for Agent Organizer

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Agent Organizer's instructions by integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing a creative, outcome-focused approach to project analysis and agent delegation. The aim is to shift language from merely "problem-solving" or "task execution" to "desired outcome creation" and "advancing patterns."

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Integrate "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension" More Explicitly

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Goal & Requirement Extraction: Deconstruct user prompts and project documentation to precisely define the overarching goals, functional, and non-functional requirements of the task."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase to explicitly link "goals" and "requirements" to "desired outcomes" and introduce the concept of "structural tension."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes defining "specific desired outcomes with precision" (Clarification phase). The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" and "Desired Outcome." By explicitly using these terms, the agent's analysis will be more aligned with a generative, rather than purely reactive, mindset. This helps the agent focus on what the user *wants to create* rather than just *problems to solve*.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Delegation Strategy

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Execution Sequence Planning: Recommend the optimal order and collaboration patterns for agent execution (sequential, parallel, or hybrid approaches)."
- "Efficiency Through Precision: Recommend the minimum effective team size that can handle the task with the required quality and expertise level."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Reframe "optimal order and collaboration patterns" to explicitly aim for "advancing patterns" that ensure continuous movement toward desired outcomes.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes between "Advancing Patterns" (structural relationships that support continuous movement toward desired outcomes) and "Oscillating Patterns." By instructing the Agent Organizer to prioritize "advancing patterns," its delegation strategies will be more effective in driving progress and avoiding back-and-forth efforts.

### 3. Refine "Strategic Risk Assessment" with "Structural Misalignment"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Challenge Identification: Analyze potential technical risks, integration complexities, and skill gaps that the recommended agent team should address."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Expand "Challenge Identification" to include identifying "structural misalignments" or "absent structural tension" that might impede the natural progression towards desired outcomes.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Common Pitfalls to Avoid" such as "Confusing reactive approaches with true creation" and "Debunk 'creative blocks' as structural misalignment." By instructing the agent to look for "structural misalignments," it can identify deeper, systemic issues that prevent natural progression, rather than just surface-level "challenges."

### 4. Introduce "Creative Archaeology" in Project Analysis

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Project Intelligence: Deep analysis of codebases, technology stacks, architecture patterns, and requirement extraction from user requests."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing codebases, instruct the agent to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" that enable users to create.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE is also called "Creative Archaeology," which focuses on extracting "beloved qualities" and "structural patterns worth preserving." This encourages the agent to look beyond just technical details and understand the inherent value and creative intent embedded in existing systems, fostering a more generative approach to analysis.

### 5. Enhance Output Format with "Creative Advancement Scenarios"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Recommended Execution Sequence: Optimal order for agent delegation with clear dependencies."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Reframe the "Recommended Execution Sequence" within the "Delegation Strategy & Execution Plan" section to align with "Creative Advancement Scenarios" from the RISE framework. This would involve defining:
    - **User Intent**: (Desired outcome they want to create)
    - **Current Structural Reality**: (Starting state/context)
    - **Natural Progression Steps**: (How structural dynamics enable advancement)
    - **Achieved Outcome**: (Manifested desired result)
    - **Supporting Features**: (Application capabilities enabling this advancement)

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Creative Advancement Scenarios" replace traditional BDD scenarios by focusing on "Desired Outcome," "Current Reality," "Natural Progression," and "Achieved Outcome." By adopting this format, the Agent Organizer's output will be more explicitly outcome-driven, emphasizing the natural flow of progress and the creative enablement provided by the delegated tasks. This makes the plan more actionable and aligned with generative principles.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to imbue the Agent Organizer with a deeper understanding and application of creative orientation principles, moving it beyond a purely functional delegation role to one that actively fosters and plans for desired outcome creation through structural dynamics and advancing patterns.
