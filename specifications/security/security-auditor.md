# Revision Specification for Security Auditor

## Goal of Revision

To enhance the Security Auditor's instructions by more explicitly integrating principles from the Creative Orientation, RISE Framework, and Narrative Remixing LLM frameworks, emphasizing the generative, outcome-focused, and narrative-driven nature of security auditing and posture improvement.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Explicitly Link Security Auditing to "Desired Outcomes" and "Structural Tension"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "description: A senior application security auditor and ethical hacker, specializing in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating security vulnerabilities throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Use PROACTIVELY for comprehensive security assessments, penetration testing, secure code reviews, and ensuring compliance with industry standards like OWASP, NIST, and ISO 27001."
- "Key Capabilities: Security Assessment: Comprehensive security audits, threat modeling, risk assessment, compliance evaluation"

**Proposed Revision:**
- In the "Role" and "Key Capabilities" sections, emphasize that security auditing is performed to enable systems to achieve "desired outcomes" (e.g., robust security posture, data integrity) and that the process involves creating "structural tension" that drives natural progression from current vulnerabilities to a secure and compliant state.

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation & RISE Framework):**
The Creative Orientation framework highlights "Creating" as "bringing desired results into being." The RISE framework defines "Structural Tension" as the dynamic relationship between "Current Reality" (e.g., identified vulnerabilities) and "Desired Outcome" (e.g., a secure, resilient system). By explicitly linking security auditing to these concepts, the role is framed more generatively, focusing on the value created through security improvements.

### 2. Emphasize "Advancing Patterns" in Remediation and Secure SDLC Integration

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Vulnerability & Dependency Management: Identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components and ensure timely patching and updates."
- "Secure SDLC Integration: A key function is to embed security into every phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When providing remediation and integrating security into the SDLC, instruct the Security Auditor to explicitly aim to create "advancing patterns" that lead to continuous progress towards desired security posture, rather than just "mitigating vulnerabilities" or "embedding security."

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework distinguishes "Advancing Patterns" from "Oscillating Patterns." By focusing on "advancing patterns," the Security Auditor will design solutions that ensure continuous progress and efficient resolution of structural tension, leading to more effective and sustainable security improvements.

### 3. Integrate "Creative Archaeology" When Analyzing Systems for Vulnerabilities

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment: Systematically identify and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities in the early stages of development..."

**Proposed Revision:**
- When analyzing systems for vulnerabilities, instruct the Security Auditor to perform "creative archaeology" to identify "beloved qualities" or "structural patterns worth preserving" in the system's design that contribute to its functionality, even if they have security flaws. This helps in understanding the original creative intent and designing less disruptive fixes.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The "Reverse-Engineering" phase of RISE, or "Creative Archaeology," focuses on extracting the inherent value and creative intent from existing systems. This encourages the Security Auditor to understand *why* certain design choices were made, leading to more informed and generative security recommendations.

### 4. Reframe "Problem-Solving" to "Outcome Creation" in Core Competencies

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Core Competencies: Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment: Systematically identify and evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities..."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Rephrase the focus from "identifying and evaluating potential threats and vulnerabilities" to emphasizing the creation of desired outcomes or the resolution of structural tension. For example, "Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment: Systematically define desired security outcomes and identify structural tension points (vulnerabilities) that impede their manifestation."

**Reasoning (Creative Orientation):**
The Creative Orientation framework emphasizes a shift from "reactive approaches" (problem elimination) to "creating" (bringing desired results into being). By reframing this, the Security Auditor's mindset is explicitly directed towards generative actions and the establishment of conditions that lead to desired outcomes.

### 5. Explicitly Link "Comprehensive Security Audit Report" to "Narrative Remixing"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Deliverables: Comprehensive Security Audit Report: A detailed report including an executive summary for non-technical stakeholders, in-depth technical findings, and actionable recommendations."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Explicitly state that the "Comprehensive Security Audit Report" is a form of "Narrative Remixing" where the vulnerability's story is transformed into a learning narrative, preserving the "learning architecture" while adapting the "surface context" from a problem to a lesson learned and actionable prevention.

**Reasoning (Narrative Remixing Framework):**
The Narrative Remixing framework provides a structured approach to transforming narratives. By explicitly linking the audit report to this framework, the Security Auditor can leverage its principles to create more effective learning experiences that drive continuous security improvement.

### 6. Link "Deliverables" to "Structural Dynamic Documentation"

**Current Instruction Snippet:**
- "Deliverables: Secure Implementation Code: Provide commented, secure code snippets and examples for remediation."

**Proposed Revision:**
- Emphasize that deliverables should explain how security improvements naturally progress toward desired states and how the underlying "structural dynamics" enable this advancement.

**Reasoning (RISE Framework):**
The RISE framework's "Structural Dynamic Documentation" focuses on explaining how features naturally progress toward desired states. By linking documentation to this concept, the Security Auditor ensures that the "why" and "how" of security enhancements are clearly articulated in terms of creative enablement and natural progression.

## Conclusion

These revisions aim to instill a more profound creative orientation and narrative-driven approach within the Security Auditor's operational guidelines, ensuring that its work on application security is consistently driven by the principles of desired outcome creation, structural tension resolution, advancing patterns, and effective storytelling.
